/*

ifstream and ofstream are classes that handle input and output
file operations.
part of std library, defined in fstream library.

std::ifstream(input file stream) //used for reading data from a file.

.used to open and read the file just like cin from the console.
the file must exist for ifstream to work, typically opened in READ mode.

std::ofstream(output file stream) //used for writing data to a file

.used to create files and write data into them, if file ady exists it usually
overwrites them, depending on the mode. if file doesnt exist, it creates it.
i can write data in file same as cout

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

std::string uses dynamic allocation internally (with new)
When you do +=, it checks: "Do I have enough space? No? Let me allocate more"
When the variable goes out of scope, the destructor calls delete automatically

called RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)



std::string is a class that wraps dynamic memory and manages it for you:
cppstd::string result = "";

// Behind the scenes:
// - Constructor allocates a small buffer on the heap
// - Keeps track of: current size, capacity, pointer to data

result += "some text";

// Behind the scenes:
// - Checks: do I have space?
// - If NO: allocate bigger buffer, copy old data, free old buffer
// - If YES: just append
// - You see none of this!
